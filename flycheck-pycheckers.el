;;
;; This package provides a way to run multiple syntax checkers on Python code,
;; in parallel.  The list of supported checkers includes:
;;
;; - pylint
;; - flake8
;; - pep8
;; - pyflakes
;; - mypy (for both Python 2 and 3)
;; - bandit
;;
;; This is an alternative way of running multiple Python syntax checkers in
;; Flycheck that doesn't depend on Flycheck's chaining mechanism.

;; Flycheck is opinionated about what checkers should be run (see
;; https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/185), and chaining is difficult
;; to get right (e.g. see https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/836,
;; https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck/issues/1300).  This package assumes
;; that the user knows what they want, and can configure their checkers
;; accordingly -- if they want to run both flake8 and pylint, that's fine.
;;
;; This also allows us to run multiple syntax checkers in parallel, rather than
;; sequentially.
;;
;; Quick start:
;;
;; Installation via MELPA is easiest:
;;
;;     M-x install-package flycheck-pycheckers
;;
;; Then, in your `init.el':
;;
;; (global-flycheck-mode 1)
;; (with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
;;   (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-pycheckers-setup))
;;
;; Start editing a Python file!
;;
;; For more details on using Flycheck in general, please see
;; http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/user/quickstart.html.  The error list
;; (viewable with `flycheck-list-errors', bound to `C-c ! l' by default) shows
;; a unified view of all errors found by all checkers, with line and column
;; information where available.
;;
;; flycheck-pycheckers can run over any Python file right away, without needing
;; to set up virtual environments or driver scripts.  You will simply need to
;; ensure that the checkers you want to run (pep8, mypy, flake8, etc.) are
;; installed somewhere on your PATH where Emacs can find them.
;;
;; Alternatives:
;;
;; * Other Flycheck-based checkers -
;;   http://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/languages.html#python.  Some are
;;   officially part of the Flycheck package, and some (like this one) are
;;   external plugins.
;;
;; * Flymake - https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/FlyMake.  Flymake is an older
;;   syntax-checking minor mode for Emacs, and is generally less supported and
;;   featureful than Flycheck.
;;
;; Configuration options:
;;
;; _You can use this package without needing to get into these details at first
;; -- they are intended for power users and those needing more customization._
;;
;; There are a number of options that can be customized via
;; `customize-variable', which all start with `flycheck-pycheckers-`.  These
;; include:
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-args' - general arguments to pass to `pycheckers.py'.
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-checkers' - the set of checkers to run (pylint, pep8,
;;    mypy, etc.).  Can be set in `.pycheckers' files with the variable
;;    `checkers' as a comma-separated list of checker names.
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-ignore-codes' - a set of error codes to universally
;;   ignore.  These can be set more granularly (e.g. per-project) using the
;;   `.pycheckers' file described below.
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-max-line-length' - the default maximum line
;;   length.  Can be overridden via `.pycheckers' file.
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-multi-thread' - whether to run each checker
;;   simultaneously in its own thread, for performance.
;;
;; * `flycheck-pycheckers-venv-root' - a directory containing Python virtual
;;   environments, so that imports may be found.
;;
;; Additionally, a `.pycheckers' file may be created in a directory to control
;; options for every file under this directory.  These files may be logically
;; combined, so a project may have one set of options that may be selectively
;; overridden in a specific subdirectory.
;;
;; Example .pycheckers file:
;;
;;     [DEFAULT]
;;     max_line_length = 120
;;     mypy_config_file = ci/mypy.ini
;;
;; Variables that can be set in the configuration file include the following.
;; Note that these are implemented as modifying the values received by
;; `argparse' in the `pycheckers.py' script, so running `bin/pycheckers.py
;; --help` is a good way to find other options that may be specified.
;;
;; * `max-line-length' - the maximum allowable line-length.  This is a good
;;   option to place in a project-specific directory if you have a personal
;;   line length preference set by default via
;;   `flycheck-pycheckers-max-line-length', but also work on projects that
;;   follow different standards.
;;
;; * `checkers' - a comma-separated list of checkers to be run for files under
;;   this directory.  If, for instance, pep8 should not be run on a directory of
;;   auto-generated code, this option can accomplish that.
;;
;; * `ignore_codes' - a comma-separated list of error/warning codes to ignore
;;   for files under this directory.  Replaces the current set of codes
;;   completely.
;;
;; * `merge_configs' - whether to keep traversing upwards when parsing
;;   `.pycheckers' files, or stop at this one.
;;
;; * `extra_ignore_codes' - a comma-separated list of error/warning codes to
;;   add to the current set of ignored errors.  This can be used to make
;;   certain directories conform to different levels of syntax enforcement.
;;   For example, a directory containing auto-generated code may omit various
;;   warnings about indentation or code style.
;;
;; * `pylint_rcfile' - the location of a project-specific configuration file
;;   for pylint
;;
;; * `mypy_config_file' - the location of a project-specific configuration file
;;   for mypy
;;
;; * `flake8_config_file' - the location of a project-specific configuration file
;;   for flake8
